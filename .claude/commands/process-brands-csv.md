Process every brand in `to-process.csv` sequentially, writing results to `results.csv` and removing each row from `to-process.csv` after it is successfully written. This gives full resumability: if the command is interrupted, re-running it continues from where it left off.

## Input and output files

- **Input:** `to-process.csv` — columns: `Name`, `List` / `Source` / `Source List` (case-insensitive), `Location`
- **Output:** `results.csv` — columns: `brand_name`, `source_name`, `country`, `website`, `instagram_handle`, `x_handle`, `manual_review`, `confidence_score`, `confidence_signals`, `notes`

An optional argument can override the input filename: $ARGUMENTS (if provided, treat it as the path to the input CSV instead of `to-process.csv`).

## Setup steps (do these once before the loop)

1. Read the input CSV. Count the total number of rows — you will need this for progress logging.
2. Check whether `results.csv` exists. If it does not, create it now with just the header row:
   `brand_name,source_name,country,website,instagram_handle,x_handle,manual_review,confidence_score,confidence_signals,notes`
3. If `results.csv` already exists but has no header, prepend the header row before continuing.

## Processing loop

Repeat the following steps for each row in the input CSV, in order from top to bottom.

### Step 1 — Log progress
Print to the terminal:
```
Processing <N>/<total>: <Name> (<Location>)…
```
where N is the 1-based index of the current row.

### Step 2 — Research the brand
Use web search to find the official Instagram and X handles for this brand. Follow the same research logic as the `/find-brand-handle` command:

**2a. Find the official website**
Search: `"<Name>" official site <Location>`
Identify the brand's official website URL. Check the website footer and about/contact pages for linked Instagram or X URLs. Any handle found here is highest priority.

**2b. Find the Instagram handle**
Search: `"<Name>" Instagram official`
Also try: `site:instagram.com "<Name>"`
Identify all candidate Instagram accounts. Note follower counts, verified badge, and whether bio links to the official website.

**2c. Find the X handle**
Search: `"<Name>" Twitter X official`
Also try: `site:x.com "<Name>"`
Identify all candidate X accounts. Note follower counts, verified badge, and whether bio links to the official website.

**2d. Select the best handle for each platform**
Priority order:
1. Handle linked directly from the brand's official website
2. Global handle preferred over a regional variant only when it is website-linked AND has a higher follower count — both conditions must be true
3. Handle with the highest follower count among all candidates (global or regional)
4. Other verification signals if follower counts are unavailable: bio links to the official website, cross-source confirmation, handle name match, verified badge
5. If no handle can be found with reasonable confidence, use `-` for that field and flag for manual review

### Step 3 — Score confidence (0–100)
Start at 0. Apply signals found during research, then cap between 0 and 100.

Positive:
- +50 handle linked directly from the brand's official website
- +30 profile bio links back to the brand's official website
- +25 handle confirmed across multiple independent sources (press, Wikipedia, directories)
- +20 selected account has the highest follower count among multiple candidate accounts for this platform
- +18 handle name is an exact or near-exact match to the brand name
- +15 verified badge confirmed on the selected account

Negative:
- −15 multiple competing accounts with no clear winner
- −10 handle found via web search only, not on official website
- −10 follower count could not be verified
- −5 selected account is a regional variant and a global account also exists

Set `manual_review` to `true` if confidence is below 50 or if meaningful ambiguity remains.

### Step 4 — Build the result row
Construct a single CSV row with these fields:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `brand_name` | `Name` from input |
| `source_name` | Value from the `List`, `Source`, or `Source List` column (case-insensitive); empty string if none present |
| `country` | `Location` from input |
| `website` | Official website URL found, or empty |
| `instagram_handle` | Handle without `@`, or `-` if not found |
| `x_handle` | Handle without `@`, or `-` if not found |
| `manual_review` | `true` or `false` |
| `confidence_score` | Integer 0–100 |
| `confidence_signals` | Signals joined with `; ` (e.g. `multiple_sources; handle_matches_brand`) |
| `notes` | Start with where each handle was found, then any caveats. One or two sentences. |

Escape any commas or double-quotes in field values per RFC 4180 (wrap field in double-quotes, escape internal double-quotes as `""`).

### Step 5 — Append to results.csv
Append the result row as a new line at the end of `results.csv`. Do not rewrite the whole file — append only. Confirm the row was written before moving to Step 6.

### Step 6 — Remove the processed row from the input CSV
Remove **only** the row just processed from the input CSV, leaving the header and all remaining rows intact. Rewrite the file with that one data row removed. This ensures that if the command is interrupted, re-running it resumes from the next unprocessed brand.

### Step 7 — Log completion
Print to the terminal:
```
✓ <N>/<total>: <Name> — instagram: <handle or "-">, x: <handle or "-">, confidence: <score>
```
Then continue to the next row.

## After the loop

When all rows have been processed (the input CSV contains only the header row), print:
```
Done. <total> brand(s) processed. Results written to results.csv.
```

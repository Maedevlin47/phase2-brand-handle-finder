Find the official Instagram and X (Twitter) handles for a brand using web search, then return a single result row with a confidence score.

## Input

The brand name is provided as the argument to this command: $ARGUMENTS

If no brand name is given, ask the user to provide one before proceeding.

## Steps

Work through these steps in order. Use web search for each one.

**Step 1 — Find the official website**
Search: `"$ARGUMENTS" official site`
Identify the brand's official website URL. Then check the website's footer, header, and contact/about pages for any linked Instagram or X (Twitter) URLs. Record any handles found here — these are the highest-confidence signals.

**Step 2 — Find the Instagram handle**
Search: `"$ARGUMENTS" Instagram official`
Also try: `site:instagram.com "$ARGUMENTS"`
Identify all candidate Instagram accounts (global, regional, sub-brand). Note follower counts, verified badge status, and whether the bio links back to the official website.

**Step 3 — Find the X handle**
Search: `"$ARGUMENTS" Twitter X official`
Also try: `site:x.com "$ARGUMENTS"`
Identify all candidate X accounts. Note follower counts, verified badge status, and whether the bio links back to the official website.

**Step 4 — Cross-reference and select the best handle**
For each platform, select the best handle using this priority order:
1. Handle linked directly from the brand's official website
2. Global handle preferred over a regional variant only when it is website-linked AND has a higher follower count — both conditions must be true
3. Handle with the highest follower count among all candidates (global or regional)
4. Other verification signals if follower counts are unavailable: bio links to the official website, cross-source confirmation, handle name match, verified badge
5. If no handle can be identified with reasonable confidence, use `-` for that field and flag for manual review

**Step 5 — Score confidence (0–100)**
Start at 0. Apply the following, then cap the result between 0 and 100.

Positive signals (add points):
- +50 — handle linked directly from the brand's official website
- +30 — profile bio links back to the brand's official website
- +25 — handle confirmed across multiple independent sources (press, Wikipedia, directories)
- +20 — selected account has the highest follower count among multiple candidate accounts for this platform
- +18 — handle name is an exact or near-exact match to the brand name
- +15 — verified badge found on the selected account

Deductions (subtract points):
- −15 — multiple competing accounts found with no clear winner
- −10 — handle found via search only, not on official website
- −10 — follower count could not be verified
- −5 — selected account is a regional variant and a global account also exists

**Step 6 — Write the notes field**
Begin with exactly where each handle was found (e.g. "Instagram handle found in website footer. X handle found via web search."). Then add any caveats, ambiguities, or flags worth reviewing. Keep to one or two sentences.

## Output

Return exactly one result in this format — a plain text block followed by a markdown table:

```
brand_name        | instagram_handle | x_handle | confidence_score | notes
------------------|------------------|----------|------------------|------
$ARGUMENTS        | <handle or ->    | <handle or -> | <0-100>     | <notes>
```

Rules:
- Do not include the `@` symbol in handles
- Use `-` (not empty) when a handle is not found
- The notes field must state where each handle was found before any other context

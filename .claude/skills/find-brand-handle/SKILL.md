description: Find the official Instagram and X (Twitter) handles for a brand using web search. Supports single-brand interactive mode and CSV batch mode.
---

Find the official Instagram and X (Twitter) handles for a brand using web search. Supports two modes:

- **CSV batch mode** (primary): `$ARGUMENTS` ends in `.csv` — process every brand in the file
- **Single-brand mode** (secondary): `$ARGUMENTS` is a brand name — look up one brand interactively

---

## Token efficiency rules

Follow these rules on every run to keep token usage lean:

- **Do not fetch pages directly.** Use only web search results (titles, snippets, URLs). Do not use WebFetch or load any URLs. Search snippet data is sufficient to identify handles.
- **Stop searching once confident.** If the first search returns a clear, unambiguous handle, do not run additional searches for that platform.
- **Do not reprocess already-found brands.** If a handle is already known from a previous result or the current conversation, skip re-researching it.

---

## Mode 1: CSV Batch Mode

Triggered when `$ARGUMENTS` ends in `.csv`.

### Setup (do once before the loop)

1. Read the input CSV. The required column is `brand_name`. Any additional columns (`source_name`, `country`, etc.) are carried through to output unchanged. Count the total rows for progress logging.
2. Check whether `results.csv` exists. If it does not, create it with this header row:
   `brand_name,instagram_handle,x_handle,confidence_score,manual_review_needed,confidence_signals,notes`
3. If `results.csv` exists, read all `brand_name` values already present — these are **already-processed brands** and must be skipped.

### Processing loop

Repeat for each row in the input CSV, top to bottom. Skip any row whose `brand_name` is already in `results.csv`.

**Step 1 — Log progress**
Print:
```
Processing <N>/<total>: <brand_name>…
```

**Steps 2–7 — Research the brand**
Follow the 6-step research flow described in Mode 2 below, substituting the current row's `brand_name` for `$ARGUMENTS`.

**Step 8 — Build the result row**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `brand_name` | From input row |
| `instagram_handle` | Handle without `@`, or `-` if not found |
| `x_handle` | Handle without `@`, or `-` if not found |
| `confidence_score` | Integer 0–100 |
| `manual_review_needed` | `TRUE` if confidence < 50, no handle found for either platform, or meaningful ambiguity remains; otherwise `FALSE` |
| `confidence_signals` | Signals joined with `; ` (e.g. `verified_badge; handle_matches_brand`) |
| `notes` | Where each handle was found, then any caveats. One or two sentences. |

Escape any commas or double-quotes per RFC 4180 (wrap field in double-quotes; escape internal double-quotes as `""`).

**Step 9 — Append to results.csv**
Append the result row as a new line. Do not rewrite the whole file.

**Step 10 — Log completion**
Print:
```
✓ <N>/<total>: <brand_name> — instagram: <handle or "-">, x: <handle or "-">, confidence: <score>, review: <TRUE/FALSE>
```

### After the loop

Print:
```
Done. <total_processed> brand(s) processed, <total_skipped> skipped (already in results.csv). Results written to results.csv.
```

## Mode 2: Single-Brand Mode

Triggered when `$ARGUMENTS` does not end in `.csv`.

If no argument is given, ask the user to provide a brand name before proceeding.

Work through these steps in order. Use web search for each one.

**Step 1 — Find the official website**
Search: `"$ARGUMENTS" official site`
Identify the brand's official website URL. Then check the website's footer, header, and contact/about pages for any linked Instagram or X (Twitter) URLs. Record any handles found here — these are the highest-confidence signals.

**Step 2 — Find the Instagram handle**
Search: `"$ARGUMENTS" Instagram official`
Also try: `site:instagram.com "$ARGUMENTS"`
Identify all candidate Instagram accounts (global, regional, sub-brand). Note follower counts, verified badge status, and whether the bio links back to the official website.

**Step 3 — Find the X handle**
Search: `"$ARGUMENTS" Twitter X official`
Also try: `site:x.com "$ARGUMENTS"`
Identify all candidate X accounts. Note follower counts, verified badge status, and whether the bio links back to the official website.

**Step 4 — Cross-reference and select the best handle**
For each platform, select the best handle using this priority order:
1. Handle linked directly from the brand's official website
2. Global handle preferred over a regional variant only when it is website-linked AND has a higher follower count — both conditions must be true
3. Handle with the highest follower count among all candidates (global or regional)
4. Other verification signals if follower counts are unavailable: bio links to the official website, cross-source confirmation, handle name match, verified badge
5. If no handle can be identified with reasonable confidence, use `-` for that field and flag for manual review

**Step 5 — Score confidence (0–100)**
Start at 0. Apply the following, then cap the result between 0 and 100.

Positive signals (add points):
- +50 — handle linked directly from the brand's official website
- +30 — profile bio links back to the brand's official website
- +25 — handle confirmed across multiple independent sources (press, Wikipedia, directories)
- +20 — selected account has the highest follower count among multiple candidate accounts for this platform
- +18 — handle name is an exact or near-exact match to the brand name
- +15 — verified badge found on the selected account

Deductions (subtract points):
- −15 — multiple competing accounts found with no clear winner
- −10 — handle found via search only, not on official website
- −10 — follower count could not be verified
- −5 — selected account is a regional variant and a global account also exists

**Step 6 — Determine manual_review_needed**
Set to `TRUE` if any of the following apply:
- Confidence score is below 50
- No handle was found for either platform (`-` in both fields)
- Meaningful ambiguity remains (e.g. multiple plausible accounts with similar follower counts)

Otherwise set to `FALSE`.

**Step 7 — Write the notes field**
Begin with exactly where each handle was found (e.g. "Instagram handle found in website footer. X handle found via web search."). Then add any caveats, ambiguities, or flags worth reviewing. Keep to one or two sentences.

### Output

Return exactly one result as a markdown table:

```
brand_name  | instagram_handle | x_handle     | confidence_score | manual_review_needed | notes
------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|------
$ARGUMENTS  | <handle or ->    | <handle or-> | <0-100>          | TRUE/FALSE           | <notes>
```

Rules:
- Do not include the `@` symbol in handles
- Use `-` (not empty) when a handle is not found
- The notes field must state where each handle was found before any other context
